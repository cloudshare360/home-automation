**Key Differences:**

- **C-8 vs. C-7:** The C-8 introduces external antennas, built-in Wi-Fi, USB-C, Zigbee 3.0, Z-Wave 800 with Long Range support, and enhanced Matter compatibility, offering better range and future-proofing over the C-7.

- **C-8 Pro vs. C-8:** The C-8 Pro upgrades to a faster ARM Cortex-A55 processor and doubles the RAM to 2 GB, resulting in approximately 50% faster performance and improved handling of large device networks and complex automations. citeturn0search5

**Considerations:**

- If you have a small to medium setup and are budget-conscious, the **C-7** remains a viable option.

- For enhanced range, built-in Wi-Fi, and better protocol support, the **C-8** is suitable for most users.

- If you require higher performance for extensive device networks or complex automations, the **C-8 Pro** is the optimal choice.

**Migration:**

Hubitat provides a migration tool to facilitate moving from older models to newer ones, including transferring Z-Wave and Zigbee devices. Note that migrating from a newer model to an older one (e.g., C-8 Pro to C-8) may require a Hub Protect subscription. citeturn0search5

Great question. When comparing **range** across the Hubitat Elevation models (C-7, C-8, C-8 Pro), you're primarily looking at **wireless signal strength** and **coverage area** for Zigbee and Z-Wave. Here’s how they differ:

---

### 📡 **Z-Wave Range:**

| Model     | Z-Wave Chip       | Z-Wave Range |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **C-7**   | Z-Wave 700        | ~100 ft (line-of-sight), typical real-world ~50 ft indoors |
| **C-8**   | Z-Wave 800 + LR   | ~150–200 ft (line-of-sight), better wall penetration |
| **C-8 Pro** | Z-Wave 800 + LR | Same as C-8, but more consistent performance due to better hardware |

✅ **Z-Wave 800 LR (Long Range)** adds **significant improvements**:
- 4x the range
- Better wall/obstacle penetration
- Lower power use
- Higher reliability

🔧 **Note:** Z-Wave LR requires compatible LR devices to fully benefit.

### 📶 **Zigbee Range:**

| Model     | Zigbee Version | Zigbee Range |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **C-7**   | Zigbee 1.2     | ~30–50 ft typical indoors |
| **C-8**   | Zigbee 3.0 + External Antennas | ~50–100 ft indoors |
| **C-8 Pro** | Zigbee 3.0 + External Antennas | Same as C-8, with slightly better signal stability |

💡 **Why C-8/C-8 Pro are better:**
- **External antennas** drastically improve range and reduce signal dropouts.
- Zigbee 3.0 has **better mesh performance** and **backward compatibility**.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

| Feature       | C-7              | C-8                      | C-8 Pro                   |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Z-Wave Range  | Good             | **Much Better** (LR)     | **Much Better** + smoother |
| Zigbee Range  | Basic            | **Improved** (external antennas) | **Same but more stable** |

So in terms of **wireless range**, the **C-8 and C-8 Pro** are major upgrades, especially if your home is larger or has thick walls. Want help choosing based on your layout?
