* SkyBell Front Door Camera with Remote lock/unlock of front door

* Thanks for laying that out so clearly! You’re looking to drop the $25/month Safe Haven subscription and still control your smart home devices through Wi-Fi with a single app, keeping all the functionality. Totally doable with some planning. Here's a breakdown of what you'll need, plus a path forward:

### 🔧 Devices You Have (and what they use)

| Device | Brand | Protocol | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| IQ Panel | Qolsys | Z-Wave/Zigbee | May be locked by Safe Haven |
| SkyBell | SkyBell | Wi-Fi | May require separate app/cloud |
| Kwikset Smart Lock | Kwikset | Z-Wave or Wi-Fi | Depends on model |
| LiftMaster Garage | myQ | Wi-Fi | Some myQ features require subscription |
| Honeywell Thermostat | Honeywell | Wi-Fi or Z-Wave | Model dependent |

---

### ✅ What You Want (Without Subscription)

1. **Remote access to front door camera + motion alerts**
2. **Lock/unlock door remotely + keypad PIN management**
3. **Garage door control remotely**
4. **Temperature control for dual-zone**
5. **One app to control everything**

---

### 🛠️ Recommendation Path: Use **Home Assistant**

**Home Assistant** is a powerful free platform that can do all of this, with no monthly fees. Here’s how it fits your setup:

#### Why Home Assistant?
- Free, open-source, local control (no cloud dependency)
- Works with Z-Wave, Zigbee, Wi-Fi devices
- Integrates with SkyBell, Kwikset, myQ, Honeywell, etc.
- Has mobile app similar to Alarm app (can lock, unlock, see video, etc.)

---

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Plan

#### 1. **Set up Home Assistant**
- Get a small device like a Raspberry Pi 4, or use a mini-PC
- Install [Home Assistant OS](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi)
- Connect it to your home network

#### 2. **Integrate Devices**

| Device | Home Assistant Integration |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| **IQ Panel** | Likely replace with Z-Wave USB stick (IQ Panel may be locked to Safe Haven) |
| **SkyBell** | Limited integration – consider replacing with Ring/Doorbird if needed |
| **Kwikset Lock** | Works via Z-Wave or Wi-Fi depending on model |
| **myQ Garage** | Home Assistant supports myQ (requires login, but no subscription) |
| **Honeywell Thermostat** | Supported if it’s Wi-Fi or Z-Wave model |

> If your Kwikset and thermostats are Z-Wave: Use a **Z-Wave USB dongle** (like Aeotec Z-Stick) with Home Assistant.

---

### 📱 App Features (Home Assistant)

- View camera feed (with compatible cams)
- Lock/unlock doors + PIN control
- Control garage and thermostat
- Set automations (e.g., motion triggers notifications)
- Works inside and outside home (via secure remote access)

---

### 📦 Optional Device Replacements (if current gear is locked or limited)

| Current | Replacement |
|--------|-------------|
| IQ Panel | Z-Wave stick + Home Assistant |
| SkyBell (limited control) | Reolink Doorbell / DoorBird / Ring with Home Assistant |
| Kwikset (if Z-Wave) | Works! |
| myQ | Works (some people use [myQ workaround](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-myq)) |
| Honeywell Thermostat | Works if Wi-Fi or Z-Wave |

---

### 🧠 Summary

You can ditch the $25/month subscription **and keep full control** of your smart home. Here's the big picture:

- ✅ Control everything via **Home Assistant App**
- ✅ Keep all automation (door, camera, thermostat, garage)
- ✅ Local control = no monthly fee
- ⚠️ May need to replace or reset some devices if they’re locked to Safe Haven
